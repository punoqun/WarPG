## Visual Distinction

```
Location: 🌲 Forest (Zone 3) (25, 25)
  Dense woodland with towering trees
```

### ANSI Color Codes

Colors help quickly identify zone type and adjust strategy.

## Strategy Tips

### 1. Know Your Elements
- Check monster weakness on encounter
- Carry multiple weapon types when possible
- Avoid zones where your attacks are resisted

### 2. Zone Matching
- Match zone to your level
- Don't skip ahead too fast
- Grinding in easier zones is valid

### 3. Equipment Planning
- Fire weapons for Tundra/Swamp/Forest
- Ice weapons for Volcano/Desert
- Holy weapons for Ruins/Dungeon
- Lightning weapons for Mountain

### 4. Risk vs Reward
- Higher zones = better loot
- But also tougher enemies
- Balance risk with current power level

### 5. Zone Rotation
- Zones cycle as you progress
- Early zones: More variety
- Mid zones: Mixed difficulty
- Late zones: Dungeons more common

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE zones (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    zoneNumber INT NOT NULL,
    zoneType VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    minLevel INT NOT NULL,
    maxLevel INT NOT NULL,
    customName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE monsters (
    -- existing fields --
    preferredZone VARCHAR(255),
    weakness VARCHAR(255),
    resistance VARCHAR(255),
    specialDropRate INT
);
```

### Zone Determination Algorithm
Zones are generated dynamically based on progressive difficulty:
1. Zones 1-2: Grassland (tutorial)
2. Zones 3-4: Grassland/Forest mix
3. Zones 5-6: Desert/Swamp (element introduction)
4. Zones 7-8: Mountain/Cave (harder combat)
5. Zones 9-10: Tundra/Ruins (advanced)
6. Zones 11-15: Mixed mid-game variety
7. Zones 16+: Dungeon-heavy end-game

### Monster Spawning
```java
Monster monster = monsterDAO.getRandomMonsterForZone(
    currentZone.getZoneType(), 
    currentPlayer.getLevel()
);
```

Monsters spawn based on:
1. Zone type preference
2. Player level ±1
3. Random selection from matching pool
